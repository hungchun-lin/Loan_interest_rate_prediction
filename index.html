        <h1>Introduction of the Loan Dataset</h1>
        <h1>Dataset Title </h1> <p>Loan data from Lending Club</p>
        <h1>Description</h1><p>This data set represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. Of course, not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a loan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And for people who are very risky? They may not even get a loan offer, or they may not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate. It is important to keep that last part in mind, since this data set only represents loans actually made, i.e. do not mistake this data for loan applications!</p>    
        <h1>Dataset Format </h1> <p>Number of records: 10000</p>
        <p>Number of fields in each record: 55</p>
      </br>
